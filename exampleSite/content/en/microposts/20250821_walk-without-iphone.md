Today, I went for a walk and left my phone at home—on purpose. At first, it felt strange, like I’d forgotten a part of me. But soon, I started noticing little things: the sound of birds, the way sunlight hit the leaves, the smile from a passerby. Without constant notifications, the world felt quieter, calmer. Sometimes, disconnecting is the best way to reconnect—with yourself and everything around you.
