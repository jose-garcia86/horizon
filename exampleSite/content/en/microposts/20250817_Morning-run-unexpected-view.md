My alarm rang at 6 AM for a run, and I almost ignored it. Glad I didn’t. As I reached the top of the hill, the sunrise painted the sky in pink, orange, and gold. It was breathtaking. I paused my playlist and just stood there, taking it all in. Sometimes, we forget that nature gives us free beauty shows every day—we just need to show up. That 30-second view was better than any Instagram photo I’ve seen this week.
