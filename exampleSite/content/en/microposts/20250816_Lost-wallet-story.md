This afternoon, I lost my wallet at the park. Panic kicked in instantly. After retracing my steps for 30 minutes, I was about to give up when a little boy came running with it in his hands. He said, “My dad told me to find you.” His father waved from a bench nearby. Everything was inside—cards, cash, even my lucky coin. It made me realize there are still genuinely good people out there. I offered them lunch as a thank-you, and we shared a nice conversation under the trees.
