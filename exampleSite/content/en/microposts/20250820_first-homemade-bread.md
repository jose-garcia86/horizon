I tried baking bread for the first time today, and honestly, I expected a disaster. The kitchen was a mess, flour everywhere, and the dough looked hopeless. But after an hour in the oven, it came out golden and perfect! The smell filled the whole house, and breaking that crusty loaf felt like a tiny victory. Itâ€™s funny how something so simple can make you feel accomplished. I might even try sourdough next time.
