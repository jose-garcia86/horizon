Today, the rain started unexpectedly while I was walking home. No umbrella, just me and the soft drizzle. Instead of rushing, I decided to slow down and enjoy the sound of raindrops on the pavement. People were running for cover, but I stayed there for a few minutes, watching the reflections of lights in the puddles. It reminded me of childhood days when rain meant freedom, not inconvenience. By the time I got home, I was soakedâ€”but strangely happy.
