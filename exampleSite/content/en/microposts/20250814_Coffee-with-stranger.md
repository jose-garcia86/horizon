This morning, I stopped by my favorite coffee shop before work. The line was long, so I ended up chatting with the person behind me. We discovered we both love old vinyl records! It’s funny how a casual conversation can turn into something meaningful. He even recommended a small record store hidden in the city that I never knew about. Sometimes, it’s the smallest interactions that brighten your day. I left with a cappuccino and a smile, promising to visit that shop this weekend.
