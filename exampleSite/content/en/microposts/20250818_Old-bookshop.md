Today I stumbled upon a small bookshop on a quiet street I rarely visit. It looked like something out of a movie—wooden shelves, the smell of old pages, and a friendly owner who seemed to know every book by heart. I asked for a recommendation, and he handed me a dusty novel, saying, “This one will stay with you.” I spent the evening reading by the window with tea in hand, feeling like I’d found a hidden treasure.
